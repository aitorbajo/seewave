\title{Spectral properties}

\description{
This function returns a list of statistical properties of a frequency spectrum.}

\usage{specprop(spec, f, str = FALSE, flim=NULL, plot = FALSE, type = "l", ...)}

\arguments{
  \item{spec}{a data set resulting of a spectral analysis obtained
      with \code{\link{spec}} or \code{\link{meanspec}} (not in dB).}
  \item{f}{sampling frequency of \code{spec} (in Hz).}
  \item{str}{logical, if \code{TRUE} returns the results in a structured table.}
	\item{flim}{a vector of length 2 to specifgy the frequency limits of the analysis (in kHz)}
  \item{plot}{if \code{1} returns the spectrum , if \code{2} returns 
      the cumulative spectrum, both of them with the first quartile, the third quartile,
      the median and the mode plotted (by default \code{FALSE}).}
  \item{type}{if \code{plot} is \code{TRUE}, type of plot that should be drawn.
      See \code{\link{plot}} for details (by default "l" for lines).}
  \item{\dots}{other \code{\link{plot}} graphical parameters.}
}

\details{
The spectrum is converted in a probability mass function (PMF).\cr
If a selected value has to be selected with \$,
the argument \code{str} has to be set to \code{FALSE}.
}

\value{
A list of 15 values is returned
  \item{mean}{mean frequency (see \code{\link{mean}})}
  \item{sd}{standard deviation of the mean (see \code{\link{sd}})}
  \item{sem}{standard error of the mean}
  \item{median}{median frequency (see \code{\link{median}})}
  \item{mad}{absolute deviation of median (see \code{\link{mad}})}
  \item{mode}{mode frequency, \emph{i.e.} the dominant frequency}
  \item{Q25}{first quartile (see \code{\link{quantile}})}
  \item{Q75}{third quartile (see \code{\link{quantile}})}
  \item{IQR}{interquartile range (see \code{\link{IQR}})}
  \item{cent}{centroï¿½d, see \code{note}}
  \item{skewness}{skewness, a measure of asymmetry, see \code{note}}
  \item{kurtosis}{kurtosis, a measure of peakedness, see \code{note}}
  \item{sfm}{spectral flatness measure (see \code{\link{sfm}})}
  \item{sh}{spectral entropy (see \code{\link{sh}})}
  \item{prec}{frequency precision of the spectrum}
}

\note{
Centroid is computed according to:\cr
    \deqn{C = \sum_{i = 1}^{N} x_i\times{y_i}}{%
    C = sum(x*y)}\cr
    with:\cr
    \emph{x} = frequencies,
    \emph{y} = relative amplitude of the \emph{i} frequency,\cr
    \emph{N} = number of frequencies.\cr\cr
Skewness is computed according to:\cr
    \deqn{S = \frac{\sum_{i = 1}^{N}(x_i-\bar{x})^{3}}{N-1}\times{\frac{1}{\sigma^{3}}}}{%
    S = sum((x-mean(x))^3)/(N-1)/sd^3}.\cr
    S < 0 when the spectrum is skewed to left,\cr
    S = 0 when the spectrum is symetric,\cr
    S > 0 when the spectrum is skewed to right.\cr
    Spectrum asymmetry increases with |S|.\cr\cr 
Kurtosis is computed according to:\cr
    \deqn{K = \frac{\sum_{i = 1}^{N}(x_i-\bar{x})^{4}}{N-1}\times{\frac{1}{\sigma^{4}}}}{%
    K = sum((x-mean(x))^4)/(N-1)/sd^4}.\cr
    K < 3 when the spectrum is platikurtic, \emph{i.e.} it has fewer items at the
    center and at the tails than the normal curve but has more items in the shoulders,\cr
    K = 3 when the spectrum shows a normal shape,\cr
    K > 3 when the spectrum is leptokurtic, \emph{i.e.} it has more items near
    the center and at the tails, with fewer items in the shoulders
    relative to normal distribution with the same mean and variance.
